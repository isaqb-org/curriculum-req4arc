# Branch Rename Verification Report

## Issue #60: Rename master to main

### Status: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETED

This document verifies that the branch rename from "master" to "main" has already been completed in the isaqb-org/curriculum-req4arc repository.

### Verification Results

#### 1. Branch Structure Analysis
- **Current branches**: main (protected, default), DE-translation, copilot/fix-60, gh-pages
- **Master branch**: ❌ Does NOT exist
- **Main branch**: ✅ Exists and is the default/protected branch

#### 2. Documentation References
All documentation correctly references the "main" branch:
- ✅ README.adoc: Contains badges and references to `/main` branch
- ✅ docs/index_rc.adoc: Links point to `/main` branch  
- ✅ All workflow files target "main" branch

#### 3. GitHub Workflows
All GitHub Actions workflows are properly configured for "main":
- ✅ `.github/workflows/build_main.yml`: Triggers on `branches: [ main ]`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/build_pr.yml`: Triggers on PR to `branches: [ main ]`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/build_releasecandidate.yml`: Uses `@main` for workflow reference
- ✅ `.github/workflows/update_pr_with_comment.yml`: No branch-specific configuration

#### 4. Build System Verification
- ✅ Build system works correctly with current branch structure
- ✅ Documentation generation successful
- ✅ No references to "master" branch found in build configuration

#### 5. Git History Analysis
- ✅ No historical references to "master" branch in commit messages
- ✅ Repository appears to have been set up with "main" as default from the start

#### 6. Submodule Configuration
- ✅ `.gitmodules` file contains only repository URLs, no branch references
- ✅ Submodules: pdf-theme, html-theme, license-copyright (all properly configured)

### Conclusion

The branch rename from "master" to "main" has already been completed. The repository is fully configured to use "main" as the default branch, and all references throughout the codebase, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines correctly point to the "main" branch.

**No further action is required for issue #60.**

### Recommendations

1. ✅ The repository is already compliant with iSAQB naming conventions
2. ✅ All automation and documentation work correctly with "main" branch
3. ✅ The issue can be closed as completed
