== Content
Architects and development teams often get only mediocre requirements as input for their work.Â 
The goal of this module is to equip architects with enough requirements know-how,
so that they can take educated architecture decisions, based on the real needs of stakeholders. They should either know how to elicit requirements (in agile and iterative approaches) or - at least - to know what to ask from others in their environment.
