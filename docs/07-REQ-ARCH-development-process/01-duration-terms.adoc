In contrast to the waterfall model with explicit phases for requirements engineering and system/software architecture development all modern methods strive for a very close cooperation between architects and any role that is responsible for requirements engineering. Examples for such processes include design thinking [Gerstbach], lean startup [Ries], design sprints and many of the scaling frameworks in the agile world.

Architects should also understand different ways to capture and document requirements, from managing a product backlog to creating requirements documents - and the relationship of such requirements documents to architecture documentation.
