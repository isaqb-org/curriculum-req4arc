Behavior Driven Development (originally suggested by [North]) aims at closing the gap between specification of requirements and automated testing by advocating close collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants. With BDD, requirements are formulated in a way that can later be used to run automated tests. Thus, BDD is one example of executable specifications.

Behaviour Driven Development (or BDD) therefore is a collaborative requirements discovery practice that uses conversations around concrete examples to build a shared understanding.
