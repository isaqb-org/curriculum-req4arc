[[LG-5-1]]
==== LG 5-1: Knowing about the applicability and application domains for Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

* Know that BDD originated from approaches and technologies like TDD (test-driven development) and ATDD (acceptance-test-driven development).
* Know that various options exist to add precision to requirements
** State models or activity models
** given-when-then scenarios
* Know that BDD is applicable for a broad range of IT-system types, e.g. information systems, business intelligence systems, mobile apps


[[LG-5-2]]
==== LG 5-2: Understanding principles of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

* Know that BDD is a collaborative requirements discovery practice that uses conversations around concrete examples to build a shared understanding of requirements.
* Know that collaborative workshops and discussion formats, like Three Amigo Sessions (TAS), help in getting correct  requirements.  In a TAS, the three roles "product owner" (or business analyse), "developer" and "tester" collaborate in discovering requirements.
* Know that concrete examples are a suitable way to help explore the problem domain, and they provide a basis for acceptance tests. Example mapping helps to find rules, open questions and identify new stories.
* Know that BDD explains user requirements in features, breaks features down into stories and the the stories into to (executable) examples.


[[LG-5-3]]
==== LG 5-3: Knowing Gherkin and Cucumber as examples for BDD

* Know the `Given-When-Then (GWT) syntax as proposed by Gherkin.
* Know that Given-When-Then based formulations of requirements facilitate test automation.
* Know that several tools exist to map Given-When-Then behavior specifications to the systems' source code (e.g. Cucumber, RSpec, SpecFlow, GivWenZen).
* Optionally know examples of GWT specifications with the appropriate glue code for automatic execution.
