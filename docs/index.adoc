- Requirements for Architects (Req4Arc) Curriculum -

The international Software Architecture Qualification Board (link:https://isaqb.org[iSAQB]) defines curricula on several levels for software architects.

The goal of this module is to equip architects with enough requirements know-how,
so that they can take educated architecture decisions, based on the real needs of stakeholders.

The terminology used in the iSAQB curricula can be found as a (freely available) ebook, published on https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read[Leanpub].

== Development versions

The Req4Arc Curriculum is currently maintained and published in English (EN) only.
Maintainers and volunteer reviewers collaborate on GitHub to improve the curriculum.
