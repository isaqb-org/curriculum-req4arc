==== LG 2-1: Understanding the need for some (limited) upfront activities

* Understand that even with iterative development some upfront activities are necessary.

* Know that explicit knowledge of visions, goals and relevant stakeholders are required so that the development team can take informed decisions about the systemsâ€™ architecture.
* Understand that an agreement about scope and context is required, especially about the interfaces between scope and context (i.e. the external interfaces of the product).
