Although requirements engineering today should be performed in an iterative, incremental way there is a need for some up-front activities to guide detailed requirements elicitation.
They are called a "clean start" for a project or product development.
These mainly include:

* Definition of vision and goals
* Identifying stakeholders
* Setting the scope
* “Breadth before depth” approach to allow for early prioritization and planning.
