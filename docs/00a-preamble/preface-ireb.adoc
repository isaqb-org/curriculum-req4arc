## Preface

IREB, the International Requirements Engineering Board, has been committed to educating professionals in requirements engineering for more than fourteen years. Up to 2020, more than fifty thousand people have acquired the CPRE FL certificate (Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering – Foundation Level).

As there are more than five million people working in IT worldwide, it is not surprising that there are still many development teams who neither have sufficient requirements engineering skills themselves, nor have access to specialists trained in requirements engineering – although they have to deal with requirements issues when developing and deploying software products.

This shortcoming is a good motivation for this iSAQB(R) Advanced Level module REQ4ARC. IREB welcomes this great module as it supports IREB’s mission to establish requirements engineering everywhere in IT. This module helps software architects and development teams to enter the world of professional requirements engineering. They will acquire a basic knowledge in requirements elicitation and management that will help in developing the right products with less guessing and less rework. Furthermore an awareness will be raised within development teams to ask for the right input before making critical architectural and design decisions.

We wish you success with this module and with your first steps in requirements engineering!
