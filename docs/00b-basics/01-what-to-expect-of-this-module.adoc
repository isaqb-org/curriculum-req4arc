=== Was does the module *{curriculum-short}* convey?

Architects and development teams often get only mediocre requirements as input for their work.
The goal of this module is to equip architects with enough requirements know-how, so that they can take educated architecture decisions, based on the real needs of stakeholders.
They should either know how to elicit requirements (in agile and iterative approaches) or - at least - to know what to ask from others in their environment.
